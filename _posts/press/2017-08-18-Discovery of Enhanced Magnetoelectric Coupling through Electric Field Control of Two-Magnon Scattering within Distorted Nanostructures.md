<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Electric field control of dynamic spin interactions is promising to break through the limitation of magnetostatic interaction based magnetoelectric (ME) effect. In this work, electric field control of two-magnon scattering (TMS) effect excited by in-plane lattice rotation has been demonstrated in La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO)/Pb(Mn2/3Nb1/3)-PbTiO3 (PMN-PT) (011) multiferroic heterostructure. Compared with the conventional strain-mediated ME effect, a giant enhancement of ME effect up to 950% at the TMS critical angle is precisely determined by angular resolution of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measurement. Particularly, a large electric field modulation of magnetic anisotropy (464 Oe) and FMR linewidth (401 Oe) are achieved at 173 K. The electric-field controllable TMS effect and its correlated ME effect have been explained by electric field modulation of the planar spin interactions triggered by spin-lattice coupling. The enhancement of the ME effect at various temperatures and spin dynamics control are promising paradigms for next generation voltage tunable spintronic devices.</p>
