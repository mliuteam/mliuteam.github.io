<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>To meet the demand of developing compatible and energy-ef cient  exible spintronics, voltage manipulation of magnetism on soft substrates is in demand. Here, a voltage tunable  exible  eld-effect transistor structure by ionic gel (IG) gating in perpendicular synthetic anti-ferromagnetic nanostruc- ture is demonstrated. As a result, the interlayer Ruderman–Kittel–Kasuya– Yosida (RKKY) interaction can be tuned electrically at room temperature. With a circuit gating voltage, anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) ordering is enhanced or converted into an AFM–FM intermediate state, accompanying with the dynamic domain switching. This IG gating process can be repeated stably at different curvatures, con rming an excellent mechanical property. The IG- induced modi cation of interlayer exchange coupling is related to the change of Fermi level aroused by the disturbance of itinerant electrons. The voltage modulation of RKKY interaction with excellent  exibility proposes an appli- cation potential for wearable spintronic devices with energy ef ciency and ultralow operation voltage.</p>
