<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) is of great importance in RF/microwave devices for its low loss, low intrinsic damping, and high permeability. Nevertheless, tuning of YIG-based multiferroics is still a challenge due to its near-zero magnetostriction and the difficulty of building epitaxial interface between ferromagnetic garnet and ferroelectric perovskite phases. In this work, the vertically aligned heterostructure of YIG:BTO/STO(001) with local epitaxial interface between BTO and YIG is well-constructed, where the single crystal BTO pillars are embedded in YIG matrix. A large magnetoelectric coupling effect that drives YIG’s FMR shift up to 512 and 333 Oe (1–2 order greater than those of all state-of-the-art progresses) is obtained through BTO ferroelectric phase changes induced by temperature variation at 295 and 193 K, correspondingly. This record high magnetoelectric tunability of YIG paves a way toward thermal/electrical tunable YIG devices.</p>
