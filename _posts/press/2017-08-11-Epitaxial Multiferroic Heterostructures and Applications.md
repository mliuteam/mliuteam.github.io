<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The ever increasing demand for ultra-low power electronics has propelled the exploration of novel multiferroics for realizing voltage control of magnetism in an energy efficient manner. Epitaxial multiferroic heterostructures, possessing a strong lattice-coupled mechanical interface and allowing an electric field (E-field) significantly modulating spin, charge, lattice and orbital order parameters, have drawn great attentions for creating novel magnetoelectric (ME) coupling effects. In this work, we review the recent progresses on control of ME properties in epitaxial multiferroic heterostructures, including their novel physical properties, various strong interfacial ME interactions and potential applications. Meanwhile, the essential interfacial couplings, allowing cross-tuning of lattice and charge-coupled parameters, have been extensively reviewed. Electric tuning of magnetism in epitaxial multiferroic heterostructures provides a great platform to develop lightweight, compact and energy-efficient spintronic or electronic devices.</p>
