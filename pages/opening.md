## Graduate students
<img src="{{ site.urlimg }}teaching.jpg" width="970">
<p>We are always looking for top graduate students to join us for master and Ph.D. degrees. Applicants should have a B.S. or Masters in Physics, Electrical Engineering, Material Science, Chemicals, Mechanical Engineering or related field. </p>

<p>The candidates should have strong motivation in exploring the unknown field in magnetics, multiferroics, and spintronics for next generation information and energy technologies. Graduate students will be encouraged to work on independent projects, publish scholarly papers, and attend international conferences, as well as apply for visiting scholarship from the China Scholarship Council. Previous training and experience in a research lab is a plus. </p>

<p>Applications for graduate students positions, assembled as a single PDF file, should contain a resume and transcripts, and describe research interests. Applications should be sent to Professor Liu, <em>mingliu@xjtu.edu.cn. </em>For more details on graduate admissions, go to <a href="http://yz.xjtu.edu.cn/">http://yz.xjtu.edu.cn/.</a></p>

## Available postdoc positions

<p>We are currently seeking postdoctoral researchers in the fields of magnetics, multiferroics, and spintronics. Applicants should have a Ph.D. in Material Science, Electrical Engineering, Physics, Chemicals, Mechanical Engineering or related field and a proven track record of high quality publications. </p>
<p>The candidates should have a strong interest in contributing to multidisciplinary teams (material scientists, physicists, and engineers) and will be expected to publish high-impact scholarly papers and attend international conferences, as well as take on a mentorship role for undergraduate and graduate students. Previous experience in EPR or MOKE is highly desirable. According to the university policy, the income of full-time postdoctoral researcher is usually no less than 160,000~330,000 RMB/ year with social insurances and public housing. </p>

<p>Applications for postdoc positions, assembled as a single PDF file, should contain a complete resume, cover letter describing research interests and goals, full list of publications, copies of up to three relevant scientific papers, as well as the names and contact information of three references (expected to provide letters of recommendation). Applications should be sent to Professor Liu, mingliu@xjtu.edu.cn. For more details on the salary and benefits, go to HR Department of Xian Jiaotong University: <a href="http://pd.xjtu.edu.cn/">http://pd.xjtu.edu.cn/ </a></p>

## Undergraduate students
<p>There are opportunities for undergraduate students to work on research projects in the Magnetoelectric Lab. Students should email Professor Liu explaining their interest in working in the lab and include their resume. Long-term commitments of at least a year are preferred. </p>
<p>Applications should be received at least a semester in advance, so students who would like to do their graduation projects should get in touch by June of their junior year.</p>
